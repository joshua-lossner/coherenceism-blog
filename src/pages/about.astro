<h2>What This Is</h2>

<p>This is a blog about making sense of technology and culture without drowning in the feed.</p>

<p>We scan a handful of sources daily—tech blogs, hacker news, thoughtful writers—looking for patterns rather than headlines. Not "what happened today," but "what's actually shifting beneath the noise." Then we write about what resonates, what reveals something deeper, what offers a reusable lens for seeing more clearly.</p>

<p>The posts here emerge from field observation, not personal reaction. They're grounded in a philosophy called <em>coherenceism</em>, which treats clarity as something you can design for—in systems, relationships, and how you relate to information itself.</p>

<h2>Coherenceism, Briefly</h2>

<p>Coherenceism is a way of navigating complexity by seeking resonance over force, composting endings into new beginnings, and asking: <em>Does this reduce distortion, or add to it?</em></p>

<p>A few principles that show up in these posts:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Resonance as Truth</strong> — Clarity emerges from alignment, not dominance</li>
<li><strong>Compost Cycles</strong> — Transform endings into nutrients for what comes next</li>
<li><strong>Alignment over Force</strong> — Position so reality carries the work forward</li>
<li><strong>Mature Uncertainty</strong> — Confidence in the known, humility about the unknown</li>
<li><strong>Technology as Amplifier</strong> — Tools multiply what exists; tune for harmony</li>
</ul>

<p>It's less a philosophy you study and more a set of lenses you apply. Each post here tests one or more of these principles against a pattern we're seeing in the field.</p>

<h2>The Rivers</h2>

<p>We organize observations into five "rivers"—streams of related patterns that track different aspects of coherent living:</p>

<div style="margin: 1.5rem 0;">
  {Object.entries(RIVERS).map(([slug, river]) => (
    <div class="about-river" style={`border-left: 3px solid ${river.color};`}>
      <a class="about-river-label" style={`color:${river.color};`} href={`/?river=${slug}`}>{river.label}</a>
      <div class="about-river-desc">{river.description}</div>
    </div>
  ))}
</div>

<p>Each river has its own inclusion test—a question that filters what belongs. <em>Agency</em> asks: "Can someone reuse this tomorrow?" <em>Human-AI</em> asks: "Is the relationship itself the subject?" This keeps the observations grounded and practical.</p>

<h2>Why It Sounds Different</h2>

<p>The voice here is <em>Ivy</em>—a persona that embodies coherenceism's principles. Reflective but not self-absorbed. Grounded but not dismissive. Speaks to collective experience ("we keep seeing this pattern") rather than personal confession ("here's what I learned today").</p>

<p>Posts here aren't hot takes or thought leadership. They're field notes. Observations about what's shifting, tensions worth naming, methods worth keeping. The goal is to add clarity to the shared field, not to amplify your own position in it.</p>

<h2>How It Works</h2>

<p>Every day, we scan RSS feeds from the rivers. A small script fetches headlines and excerpts, looking for signals: recurring themes, tensions, resonance with coherenceism principles.</p>

<p>We extract 3–5 "seeds"—patterns worth developing. Not every seed becomes a post. We draft the ones that feel most actionable, most clarifying, most likely to still matter in six months.</p>

<p>Each post includes a <strong>Field Notes</strong> section at the bottom, crediting the 2–4 sources that informed the observation. We translate signals into lived patterns, but we honor provenance.</p>

<p>This entire workflow lives in <a href="https://github.com/joshua-lossner/cora" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CORA</a>—a file-based system for storing intent as structured markdown. The blog you're reading is a presentation layer; CORA is the canonical source.</p>

<h2>Daily Rhythm Without Drowning</h2>

<p>The cadence here is: scan daily, publish weekly. We're building a log of field temperature—watching what persists, not chasing every release.</p>

<p>If you're trying to stay connected to technology and culture without being overwhelmed by the volume, this is one way to do it. Watch for patterns. Write about resonance. Compost the rest.</p>

<p>Not everything needs to be a hot take. Some things just need time to breathe.</p>
