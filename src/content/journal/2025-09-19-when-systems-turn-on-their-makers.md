# **Journal — When Systems Turn on Their Makers**

  

_“Brilliance without community isn’t strength. It’s fragility.”_

  

Fuck Trump and his fascists.

Fuck Biden and the establishment that paved the road for Trump while pretending to defend democracy.

Fuck the corporatocracy that built an economy for the wealthy and stripped the means of production from everyone else.

Fuck the media that sold us spectacle instead of truth.

Fuck the suits — the ones who knew better and chose profit over people.

And fuck capitalism for birthing the cancer.

  

That’s the vent. It’s ugly, but honest. It’s not the whole story.

### **From Anthem to Bailey**

In my teens I was drawn to Rush’s _2112_ — Neil Peart borrowing from Ayn Rand’s _Anthem_. “The Man Against the Masses.” It was intoxicating to a young mind: individualism as rebellion, selfishness dressed up as virtue. I devoured Rand, wore her armor into adulthood.

Then came the cubicles. After years in a family-run golf shop, I landed in a corporation where betrayal and infidelity hummed beneath fluorescent light. “Teamwork” meant smiling while knives slid between ribs. It confirmed my bias: groupthink was a disease.

But cracks formed. Re-reading Rand in my thirties, the rhetoric rang hollow. George Bailey from _It’s a Wonderful Life_ felt closer to truth: a man who lived not as a lone genius but as part of a fabric. He wasn’t diminished by community. He was completed by it.

### **The Price Tag on Life**

I went searching for someone who had worked out a balance between collectivism and individualism — a way of being both singular and communal without collapse. That search led me to Jacque Fresco. In the same stretch of late-night web dives, I found _The Venus Project_ and soon after Peter Joseph’s _Zeitgeist_ trilogy. Fresco’s vision landed hardest: society as a body, organs working in harmony, resources distributed for health. When parts compete, you get cancer. Capitalism is that cancer in the social organism.

Jacque Fresco’s vision landed like thunder. He saw society as a body — organs working in harmony, resources distributed for health. When parts compete, you get cancer. Capitalism is that cancer in the social organism.

And right as I found him, cancer gutted my own family. My father — proud, stubborn — was diagnosed with a rare stomach cancer. Shortly after, he was fired from the family commercial print business he had helped build. No income. Insurance that locked him out of treatments that could’ve given him years. He refused disability, worked as a security guard until he couldn’t. I’d visit him on Fridays, but by then he was too far gone to really talk. He kept repeating how he wanted to start his own print business again - even bought a small offset press for the garage.

My old boss, meanwhile — stage-4 lung cancer, wealthy — bought years of life with treatments my father never had access to. Watching him die wasn’t just grief. It was a lesson in structural violence: the price tag on survival.

It wrecked me. Depression. Withdrawal. Angie was the tether that kept me from drifting too far.

### **Ten Minutes of Hell**

In 2017 we drove west — a vacation meant as cleansing, as escape. Denver. The Rockies. Vegas. Los Angeles. Silicon Valley. Yosemite. Each stop was to carry weight. For Angie, movie studio tours, walking the backlots of stories that had shaped her childhood. For me, Silicon Valley, circling Apple’s just-built Spaceship Campus like it was some new cathedral. Both of us chasing things we held in high regard.

Driving west through the Rockies, I felt like I’d stumbled on a wonder of the world that nobody bothers to name. Those highways aren’t just concrete and rebar — they’re rivers of ingenuity cut through stone. Every curve, every carved tunnel, felt like proof that human hands can shape beauty out of necessity. It was breathtaking, and almost tragic, how little reverence we hold for it.

Then Vegas — greed, indulgence, corruption in neon. Even a Michael Jackson tribute show carried the weight of a society that demands people be someone they aren’t.

Then ten minutes of hell rained down. We were two rooms over, two floors below the shooter. I saw people cut down while running for their lives. A man dived to cover his partner during one round, she got up, he didn't. Dragging her partner, then collapsing herself in the next volley. The next morning the field was covered in white sheets.

That night welded my questions: how can someone be so entitled, so cold, that they see pulling a trigger into a crowd as their right? And why do these monsters keep appearing? They’re not accidents. They’re the byproducts of systems that profit from alienation, that prize spectacle over care.

### **Toward Coherence**

Fresco’s insight and lectures continued to mend me. He taught us, our society mistakes its cancer for health. Yet there are tools now he didn’t have. AI won’t save us, but it can map a way forward — if it’s decentralized, democratized, aligned with human flourishing instead of corporate hoarding.

That’s why I call this path Coherenceism. Fresco avoided “isms,” but language matters. People need a name to gather around. “Resource-based economy” sounded like a mechanism. Coherenceism says something simpler: align thought, action, and system with life itself.

Coherence isn’t just another “ism” for people to cling to. It’s a recognition that our survival depends on systems matching the reality of life itself. Capitalism elevates competition until it metastasizes; socialism gets caricatured into bureaucracy; technocracy risks reducing people to inputs. Coherenceism is different: it asks only one thing — that our structures make sense in relation to how humans and living systems actually work. That’s the step forward: not ideology, but alignment. When thought, action, and structure move together, you don’t have to prop society up with constant force. It sustains itself, like a body whose organs are in rhythm.

### **Stitched in Blood and Memory**

From Rand to Rush to cubicles. From George Bailey to Fresco. From my father’s hospital bed to the Vegas massacre.

The lesson is stitched in grief and blood: brilliance without community isn’t strength. It’s fragility.

We can be singular and communal at once. That’s the minimum requirement for a sane future.
