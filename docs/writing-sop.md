# Writing SOP — coherenceism.blog (Field Notes)

Purpose: Align blog writing with the canonical library on coherenceism.info. Blog entries are observations, experiments, and updates — not opinion pieces.

Tone & Stance
- Field‑note voice: descriptive, curious, provisional
- Avoid prescriptive or polemical language (“should”, “must”)
- Cite canonical concepts on first mention (link to branch/seed)

Frontmatter (add to each post)
- branch: canonical_slug (e.g., universal-mind)
- seed: canonical_slug (optional)
- tone: field-note

Structure
- Title: concrete, descriptive
- Lead: 1–2 sentences of context
- Body: what was observed, pattern noticed, link to branch/seed
- Close: what we’ll try next or an open question

Checklist (before publishing)
- Links: First mention of concepts links to coherenceism.info
- Accuracy: Claims grounded in observed patterns; avoid takes
- Clarity: Short sentences, concrete examples
- Metadata: branch/seed/tone present

Examples
- “We ran X experiment; here’s the signal we saw” (link to seed)
- “In the field, alignment failed at Y; see branch for context”
