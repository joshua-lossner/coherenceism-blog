# Privacy Policy (Template — Privacy-First)

Purpose: Set a baseline for privacy that aligns with Coherenceism (clarity, consent, stewardship).

## Principles
- Minimal collection: collect only what’s necessary to serve content.
- No sale of data: never sell or trade user data.
- Transparent usage: document what is collected and why.
- User control: provide clear ways to opt out or delete data.
- Security: use HTTPS and reasonable safeguards; disclose incidents.

## Data We Collect
- Server logs (IP, user agent) for reliability and abuse prevention.
- Optional analytics (if enabled): aggregated, anonymized metrics.

## Cookies
- Only essential cookies for session/security. No tracking cookies unless explicitly enabled with consent.

## Third Parties
- List any hosting/CDN/analytics providers used, with links to their policies.

## Your Choices
- How to opt out of analytics (if any) and request data deletion.

## Contact
- Provide a contact email or form.

Notes:
- Tailor to actual practices; keep it short, clear, and actionable.
