# Journal Post Template

Use this template for first‑person journal entries. Keep the tone reflective, concrete, and grounded. Let external news inspire the piece, but do not reference it directly.

## Frontmatter
```
---
title: "Your Title"
date: YYYY-MM-DD
river: history-systems
rivers: []
form: journal
tags: []
excerpt: One‑sentence teaser in your own voice
related: []
status: draft
featured: false

```

## Body Shape
- Optional italic epigraph or opening line
- 3–6 short sections or paragraphs (first‑person, present‑tense acceptable)
- Conclude with a simple, resonant statement (not a sales pitch)

## Notes
- Prefer paragraphs over heavy headings; if you use headings, keep them sparse.
- Avoid citing news directly; translate inspiration into lived patterns and observations.
- Keep paragraphs short (2–5 sentences) and concrete.
- Link sparingly to durable concepts or prior posts.

## Rivers (choose one)
- rest-rhythm — Rest & Rhythm
- human-ai — Human & AI: A Shared Becoming
- history-systems — History & Systems Through Coherence
- agency — AI & Human Agency
- awakening-alignment — Awakening & Alignment
