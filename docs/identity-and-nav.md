# Identity and Navigation (Coherence Guide)

Purpose: Keep identity and navigation coherent across Coherence Network properties.

## Identity
- Name: Coherenceism Journal
- Voice: calm, precise, reflective
- Visual: subdued palette with river accents; consistent typography

## Navigation
- Global: Home, Rivers, Tags, About; footer links to related properties
- Cross-site: link to `.media`, `.info`, `.ai`, `.blog`, `.social`, `.network`, `.com`
- Preserve context: keep current filter (river/tag) visible on pages

## Notes
- Keep nav minimal; reduce friction and repetition.
